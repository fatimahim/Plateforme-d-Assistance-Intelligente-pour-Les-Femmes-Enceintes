Chatbot and Risk Prediction Platform

This project involves the development of an intelligent platform that combines two major features:

A Chatbot for Pregnant Women

Based on the T5 model, fine-tuned on a dataset of 4,825 question-answer pairs.

The chatbot provides accurate and personalized responses to questions from pregnant women, ensuring ease of access to reliable information.

Risk Prediction Model

Built using a deep neural network trained on health-related data.

Predicts and classifies health risks for pregnant women based on input data such as:

Temperature

Age

Heart rate frequency

And other personal health parameters.

Classifies risk into three categories:

Low Risk

Medium Risk

High Risk

Project Features

Chatbot Functionality

Trained using TensorFlow for fine-tuning the T5 model.

Capable of handling a wide range of questions related to pregnancy.

Risk Prediction Functionality

Utilizes advanced machine learning techniques.

Allows users to enter personal health data and predicts their risk level.

Designed for early detection of potential health issues, providing actionable insights to protect the mother and baby.

Technology Stack

Backend: Django Framework

Frontend: Integrated with the Django framework for a seamless user experience.

Machine Learning Models:

T5 for the chatbot.

A deep neural network for risk prediction.

Implementation Details

Data Acquisition:

Chatbot trained on a custom dataset of 4,825 question-answer pairs.

Risk prediction model trained on personal health data.

Model Training:

Fine-tuned the T5 model using TensorFlow.

Developed the risk prediction model with deep learning techniques to ensure high accuracy.

Platform Development:

Built with Django, ensuring scalability and ease of deployment.

User Input and Prediction:

Women can log in or log out and ask the chatbot any questions about their symptoms, precautions, or potential risks related to their pregnancy.

User inputs personal health details through the platform interface. The system analyzes the data and provides a clear classification of the risk level.

The risk prediction model analyzes the data and provides a clear classification.
